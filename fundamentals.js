// NOTE: Make sure to use the `var` keyword for ALL variable declarations.

// #1: Create an array of strings called `colors` that contains three colors.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:

var colors = ["red", "white", "blue"];

// #2: Access the last item in the array and assign to a variable called `lastColor`.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:

var lastColor = "blue";

// #3: Create an empty array called `favoriteColors`.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:

var favoriteColors = [];

// #4: Create a `for` loop that adds each string in `colors` to `favoriteColors`.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:

for (let i = 0; i < colors.length; i++) {
  favoriteColors.push(colors[i]);
}

// #5: Create an object literal called `student` that contains three key-value pairs.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:

var student = {
  name: "name",
  location: "location",
  course: "course"
};

// #6: Add a `attends-office-hours` (spelled exactly) property to `student` by accessing
// it (do not change the original object you typed above) and assigning it
// a boolean value.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:

student["attends-office-hours"] = true;
